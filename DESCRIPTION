Description: A wrapper for the 'DeepL' API, a web service for translating texts between different languages. 
    Access to the official API (see <https://www.deepl.com/translator>) is subject to a monthly fee.
    No authentication key is required for the undocumented DeepL JSON-RPC API. The package provides functions
    for both types of API calls.
